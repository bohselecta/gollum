# GGUF Integration Status

## What's Done ‚úÖ

1. **Models Directory**: Created `models/` folder for GGUF files
2. **Basic GGUF Parser**: Started implementation in `gguf/parser.go`
   - Reads GGUF magic bytes and version
   - Parses tensor metadata (name, dimensions, type)
   - Supports F32 and F16 formats
   - TODO: Quantized formats (Q4_0, Q8_0, etc.)
3. **Model Loader**: `gguf/loader.go` automatically scans `models/` on startup
4. **Engine Integration**: Engine now loads models on initialization

## What's Still Needed üî®

### Critical Missing Pieces:

1. **Complete GGUF Parser**
   - Currently reads header and tensor metadata but the data layout is incomplete
   - Need to handle GGUF v2/v3 format correctly
   - Need to parse KV metadata (architecture, parameters, etc.)
   - Need to support quantized weight formats

2. **Real Tokenizer Integration**
   - Currently uses whitespace-based tokenization
   - Need to load tokenizer from GGUF metadata
   - Need to implement SentencePiece or BPE decoder
   - Need to handle model-specific vocabularies

3. **Metal Kernel Integration**
   - Current Metal shim is a stub
   - Need to implement actual forward pass
   - Need to load GGUF weights into Metal buffers
   - Need to implement attention, MLP, and layernorm kernels

4. **Model Forward Pass**
   - Embedding lookup from tokens
   - Transformer block execution (attention + feedforward)
   - Output projection to logits
   - Token sampling (top-k/top-p)

### Next Steps:

#### Option A: Use Existing Go LLM Libraries
- **Nomic GPT4All**: Has GGML/GGUF support in Go
  - Pros: Already working, tested
  - Cons: Might use CGO for some operations
- **Ollama**: Open-source model server
  - Pros: Full GGUF support, proven
  - Cons: Might be overkill

#### Option B: Complete Native Implementation
- Finish GGUF parser based on format spec
- Implement minimal Metal kernels (gemv, attention, layer norm)
- Integrate tokenizer from existing Go libraries
- This is the hardest but most "pure Go" approach

#### Option C: Hybrid Approach (Recommended)
- Use a Go GGUF parser library if available
- Focus on Metal kernel implementation for inference
- Keep scheduling/caching in pure Go (already done ‚úÖ)

## Current Limitations

The current code will:
- ‚úÖ Find `.gguf` files in `models/` directory
- ‚ùå Actually load weights (format parsing incomplete)
- ‚ùå Run inference (still uses toy backend)
- ‚ùå Use real tokenization (still whitespace-based)

## Testing Without a Model

You can still test the infrastructure:
```bash
make build
bin/altiserve
# Server will start and report: "No GGUF models found, using toy backend"
```

## Next Implementation Priority

1. **Fix GGUF parser** to correctly read tensor data section
2. **Add quantized format support** (Q4_0, Q8_0, etc.)
3. **Integrate real tokenizer** from GGUF metadata
4. **Implement Metal inference kernels** for transformer
5. **Wire everything together** in the backend

## Recommendation

For fastest path to working inference:
1. Consider using `github.com/nomic-ai/gpt4all` or similar for GGUF loading
2. Focus development on Metal kernel implementation
3. Keep the excellent caching/scheduling work you've already built

The architecture you've built (scheduler, KV cache, prefix cache, metrics) is solid. The missing piece is the actual model inference kernel.
